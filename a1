    <h1> How much it takes to capture carbon? </h1>
    <p> Carbon emission has been viewed as a serious challenge nowadays by many people, but how much does it take if we want to 
        capture carbon we emitted? According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the United States emmited 5.1 billion 
        metric tons of energy-related carbon dioxide. According to a report from David W. Keith, capturing carbon from ambient 
        air directly costs 94-232 $/t-carbon. If we plan to capture  <input type="number" id="percent" value="0">% energy-related carbon, 
        and let's say it takes 163$ to capture one metric tonne of carbon, it takes $<span id="cost">???</span> billion dollars to 
        achieve our goal.
   </p>
   
   <p> As we can see, even if we plan to remove just 5% of the energy-related carbon dioxide, it takes $<span id="cost2">???</span> 
    billion dollars. In September, 2020, the U.S. Department of Energy announced the award roughly $72 million to support carbon caupture
    technologies. As we can see, this is not comparable to how much we would've paid to capture carbon using today's technologies. Therefore,
    I argue that that it's worth it to incentivize carbon capture technologies, and maybe we should spend even more.
